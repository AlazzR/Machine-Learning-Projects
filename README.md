# Machine-Learning-Projects

**Disclaimer:** This project doesn't truely reflect my English capabilities nor my programming capabilities. I have tried to finish these mini projects as fast as possible, because I wanted to add the pattern recognition folder to my resume as fast possible in the hopes of enhancing the chances of finding job opportunities in Canada. Hence, you willn't see the best variables names and you will find some of the formulas or text in the markdown cells missing words or even you would see some of the formulas written incorrectly. 

This repository have my implementation of fundemental machine learning algorithm, in which this implementation was from scratch, as you can see in the jupyter notebooks that is provided with this repository. Unfortunately, I didn't put much effort in implementing these algorithms in what is know as the "Pythonic idiom nor the most efficient, in which you would see a lot of for-loops and the readibility of the code isn't that great. Because I had to study from Pattern recognition book and other books while implementing some of these algorithms, while adhereing to the "as fast as possible" constrains. In the beginning I have tried to provide explanation in the jupyter notebook for the machine learning technique that they corresponds to, but I find out it takes a lot of time to implement this :smile:. Therefore, as you move through the notebooks you would see lesser explanation, but I provided for each notebook the references that were used to create these notebooks.

In the future, I am planning to add more projects to this repository. But currently this repository only include my projects of fundemental machine learning algorithm that depended mainly on the pattern recognition and machine learning book. I hope you enjoy what you see in this repository and I sure hope that this repository would benefit and unravel some of the mysteries of those machine learning algorithm. And I really enjoyed the process of creating those mini-projects and I learned a lot while implementing these mini-project and I really advice you to implement them by yourself insead of relaying on the theory, because implementing these machine learning algorithm will truely create a strong foundation for the theory to rest on. Best of luck for anyone that sees this repository and I really wish to hear from you, and if you want to connect with me here is my linkedin account [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rashidalazzoni/)
