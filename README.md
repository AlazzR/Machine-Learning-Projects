# Machine-Learning-Projects

**Disclaimer:** This project doesn't truly reflect my English capabilities nor my programming capabilities. I have tried to finish these mini-projects as fast as possible, because I wanted to add the Pattern recognition folder to my resume as fast as possible in the hopes of enhancing the chances of finding job opportunities in Canada. Hence, you willn't see the best variables names and you will find some of the formulas or text in the markdown cells missing words or even you would see some of the formulas written incorrectly. 

This repository have my implementation of fundamental machine learning (ML) algorithm from scratch, as you can see in the Jupyter notebooks that is provided with this repository. Unfortunately, I didn't put much effort in implementing these algorithms in what is known as the "Pythonic‚Äù idiom nor in creating the most efficient implementation, in which you would see a lot of for-loops and the readability of the code isn't that great. Because I had to study from Pattern recognition book and other books while implementing some of these algorithms, while adhering to the "as fast as possible" constrain. In the beginning I have tried to provide explanation in the Jupyter notebooks for the ML technique that they corresponds to, but I find out it takes a lot of time to implement :smile:. Therefore, as you move through the notebooks you would see lesser explanation, but I provided for each notebook the references that were used to create those notebooks. 

In the future, I am planning to add more projects that corresponds to different books to this repository. But currently this repository only include my projects of fundamental ML algorithm that depended mainly on the pattern recognition and ML book. I hope you enjoy what you see in this repository and I sure hope that this repository would benefit you and unravel some of the mysteries of those ML algorithm. And I really enjoyed the process of creating those mini-projects and I learned a lot while implementing these mini-project and I really advice you to implement them by yourself instead of relying on the theory, because implementing these ML algorithm will truly create a strong foundation for the theory to rest on. Best of luck for anyone that sees this repository and I really wish to hear from you, and if you want to connect with me here is my LinkedIn account [LinkedIn Account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rashidalazzoni/).

In the following, you can see a list of projects with their names starting with proj_. These name corresponds to the order in which these mini-projects were created, and there are no necessary meaning of this order. I just added these acronyms to provide more structure to these mini-projects.
